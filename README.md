# Tekstanalyse-prosjekt

This project was a part of the course [TDT4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4310#tab=omEmnet).

The program uses artificial intelligience to give a draft of what the songlyrics of a song could have been if an arbitrarily chosen artist would have written it.
